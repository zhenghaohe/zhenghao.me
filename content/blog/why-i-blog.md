A small confession on my part, I am always jealous of people who have a significant amount of audience, people who inspire other people, and those so-called influencers. Because I just love being considered informative and helping. Don’t get me wrong though, I am not suggesting I am in a position of authority or anything like that. I am not an expert in anything that I do. But I aspire to be someone who have a lot of valuable information to share and any topic he touches on will likely be useful to other people. 

By any metrics, I cannot point to specific concrete benefits I will get from all these writing. It is not like grinding on Leetcode that can get you into one of those big tech companies one day. I won’t get a pay raise either. In addition, as you have probably noticed, I am writing in English, and it is not my native language, which makes writing even harder. I didn’t  come to Canada until the age of 22. I didn’t attend any private schools back in China where they provide some serious education on the English language. When I am writing in English, I have to constantly look stuff up on dictionaries and twitter, to check if a sentence sounds odd or the wording is idiomatic. Overall, the Cost-benefit ratio of writing for me is immensely low, at least for now. But I am sure it will get better over time. One of the goals of this blog is to improve my English writing skills. However you will find me writing stuff on here in Chinese from time to time.

So, welcome again to my humble abode on the internet. I am Zhenghao, a front end software engineer working at Amazon. This is my first blog post on here. And it feels good to have my own corner of the internet for the first time.
